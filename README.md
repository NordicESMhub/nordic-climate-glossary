#### Permafrost

Ground that remains at or below freezing for at least two consecutive years. Permafrost often contains ancient frozen plant remains. When the ground thaws and the plants rot, it can cause very large emissions of greenhouse gases CO2 and methane.

Global warming thaws frozen land, which in turn emits gases that enhance warming.

#### Proxies

A proxy is a way to indirectly measure aspects of climate. Biological or physical records from ice cores, tree rings, and soil boreholes are good examples of proxy data
