agree to abide by the NordicESMHub [code of conduct].

## How to Contribute

1.  If you have a [GitHub][github] account,
    or are willing to [create one][github-join],
    but do not know how to use Git,
    you can report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][issues].
    This allows us to assign the item to someone
    and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

2.  If you are comfortable with Git,
    and would like to add or change the glossary,
    you can directly submit a pull request (PR).
    Instructions for doing this are [included below](#using-github).

## Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute].
To manage changes, we follow [GitHub flow][github-flow].

Each issues and pull requests are reviewed by [NICEST2](https://neic.no/nicest2/) staff and we also encourage you to do so.
The repository owners have final say over what gets merged into the lesson so it is often good practice to discuss your plans in an issue
before you implement anything.

To use the web interface for contributing to a lesson:

1.  Fork the originating repository to your GitHub profile.
2.  Within your version of the forked repository, move to the `main` branch and
create a new branch for each significant change being made.
3.  Navigate to the file(s) you wish to change within the new branches and make revisions as required.
4.  Commit all changed files within the appropriate branches.
5.  Create individual pull requests from each of your changed branches
to the `main` branch within the originating repository.
6.  If you receive feedback, make changes using your issue-specific branches of the forked
repository and the pull requests will update automatically.
7.  Repeat as needed until all feedback has been addressed.

When starting work, please make sure your clone of the originating `main` branch is up-to-date
before creating your own revision-specific branch(es) from there.
Additionally, please only work from your newly-created branch(es) and *not*
your clone of the originating `main` branch.
